                It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
                <br> I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
                <br> I don't have much money but boy if I did 
                <br> I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
                <br>
                <br> If I was a sculptor, but then again, no 
                <br> Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show 
                <br> I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 
                <br> My gift is my song and this one's for you 
                <br>
                <br> And you can tell everybody this is your song 
                <br> It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
                <br> I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
                <br> How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
                <br>
                <br> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
                <br> Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
                <br> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song 
                <br> It's for people like you that keep it turned on 
                <br>
                <br> So excuse me forgetting but these things I do 
                <br> You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue 
                <br> Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
                <br> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
                <br>
                <br> And you can tell everybody this is your song 
                <br> It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
                <br> I hope you don't mind 
                <br> I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
                <br> How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
                <br>
                <br> I hope you don't mind 
                <br> I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
                <br> How wonderful life is while you're in the world
                <br>
